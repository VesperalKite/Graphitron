# Graphitron
We develop a domain specific language for graph processing accelerator generation targeting on complex hardware architectures such that users can focus on the basic logic of graph processing algorithms rather than combing low-level hardware details and the graph processing algorithms. Currently, we mainly target a typical server-grade FPGA device from Xilinx.
